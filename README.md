Hello world ! 

I'm a student in finance but very interested in coding. I want to apply these coding in finance in my career. 
But now my knowledge in coding is 0, except that i used to resolve Sudoku by myself in Python but i think it doesn't mean so much 
So i'm trying freecodecamp and hope have some significant advances in coding
Thanks!
