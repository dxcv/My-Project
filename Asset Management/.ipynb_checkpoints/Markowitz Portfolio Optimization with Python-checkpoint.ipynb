    "# Markowitz Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "The path-breaking insight of Markowitz was that the risk/return profiles of single assets should not be viewed separately but in their porfolio context. In this respect, portfolios are considered to be efficient if they are either risk minimal for a given return level or have the maximum return for a given level of risk. Even though both views of efficient portfolios are equivalent, the kind of portfolio optimization does differ for these two cases. The former is a **quadaratic optimization with linear constraints, whereas in the latter the objective function is linear and the constraints are quadratic**  \n",
